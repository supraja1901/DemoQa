//	Static driver: By making driver static, itâ€™s initialized only once and shared among all instances that extend Base.
//	visibility of driver is changed to protected because it has a scope of classes in its package and the inherited classes
//	by default the visibility is default where the scope is only till classes of its package
//	we should declare the variable driver outside openBrowser because then only it can be accessed by 
//		inherited classes and other methods defined in the same class
//	we should just declare driver, we should not define it. defining it outside openBrowser invokes multiple drivers while code execution

//	src/main folder has locators and resources packages 
//	resources package has base and basic actions
//	in base we initialize driver and open chrome and open the website
//	in basic actions we write all the reusable methods
//	in locators package we give all locators files each file has locators related to a particular page
//	src/test folder has package for each module to be tested and the test cases related to each module are written in separate files
